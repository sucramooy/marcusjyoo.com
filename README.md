  # Personal Engineering Portfolio

  Wow, how did you find your way here?

  Feel free to poke arround - I am a Mechanical Engineer after all so it's probably not very pretty. This site was constructed from a skeleton/framework made in figma which has been pretty extensively modified since. I don't claim to know everything about WebDev, the development process consists of a lot of copy and pasting, changing variables, and checking the dev server between every little change. Most changes would completely screw up the container. This site was designed with viewing on a desktop in mind, the site looks okay on my phone but YARMV (Your Aspect Ratio May Vary).

  Thanks for being here!

  This is a code bundle for my Personal Engineering Portfolio Website.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
